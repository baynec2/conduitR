## Overview

conduitR is an R package that provides tools for metaproteomics analysis using conduit and conduit-GUI. It offers a comprehensive suite of functions for processing, analyzing, and visualizing metaproteomics data.
These functions are designed to be used in conjunction with the [conduit](https://github.com/baynec2/conduit) and [conduit-GUI](https://github.com/baynec2/conduit-GUI) packages, or independently for custom analyses.

## Features

### Getting Data
- Download FASTA files from UniProt and NCBI
- Download and process taxonomy data from NCBI
- Manage and combine multiple proteome databases

### Data Processing
- Create custom protein sequence databases
- Associate sample proteomics data and metadata using QFeatures integration
- Transformation, imputation, and normalization of proteomics data
- Quality control and filtering options

### Statistical Analysis
- Perform LIMMA differential expression analysis
- Support for various machine learning models:
  - LASSO regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Feature importance analysis and selection
- Statistical testing and multiple testing correction

### Visualization
- Interactive heatmaps with customizable annotations
- PCA biplots with flexible aesthetics
- Taxonomic visualizations:
  - Barplots for abundance analysis
  - Heat trees for hierarchical relationships
- Volcano plots for differential expression
- KEGG pathway visualization
- Feature-specific plots
- Custom plot aesthetics and themes

### Miscellaneous
- Comprehensive logging functions
- Error handling and validation
- Integration with existing bioinformatics workflows

## Dependencies

The package requires the following R packages:
- QFeatures for proteomics data management
- limma for statistical analysis
- ggplot2 for visualization
- tidyr and dplyr for data manipulation
- Additional packages for specific functionalities (see DESCRIPTION file)

## Installation

You can install the development version of conduitR from GitHub:

```r, eval = FALSE
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("baynec2/conduitR")
```

## Usage

This is a work in progress. The package documentation and vignettes will be updated with detailed examples demonstrating:
- Data import and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis workflows
- Visualization techniques
- Integration with conduit and conduit-GUI
- Best practices and recommendations

Stay tuned for updates!
