# Conduit Database Resources

This directory contains database resources generated using the **Conduit** platform for metaproteomic analysis.

## Database Generation Details
This database was generated on **2025-04-01** by user **nanopore-catalyst** using a Linux system.
The database includes proteome information for **69991** proteins derived from **5** species

These resources can be reused for additional analyses within Conduit for experiments containing the same search space.
To do so, add the entire directory (output/00_database_resources) to the `user_input` directory. This prevents the need for regeneration, reducing overall processing time.

## Files and Their Contents

### **00_database.fasta**
This file was created by downloading reference proteomes from the **UniProt API** based on **NCBI taxonomy IDs** supplied by the user in `organisms.txt`.
- If a **reference proteome** was available, it was downloaded.
- If no reference proteome existed, the first proteome returned by the API was used.
- All proteomes were concatenated into `00_database.fasta`.

### **01_taxonomy.txt**
This file was generated by querying the **NCBI API** for taxonomic information corresponding to the taxonomy IDs in `organisms.txt`.

### **02_protein_info.txt**
This file was created by extracting information from `00_database.fasta` and formatting it into a structured table. It includes:
- Protein sequence details
- Corresponding organism information (as provided in `organisms.txt`)

### **03_database_taxonomic_tree.txt**
Taxonomic Tree of the content in the database. Size is 

### **/detected_protein_resouces/**
This directory will contain annotated resources corresponding to the proteins that were detected.
