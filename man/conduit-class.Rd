\title{Conduit Class for Integrated Proteomics Analysis}
\description{
The \code{conduit} class provides a unified container for proteomics data,
integrating quantitative measurements, taxonomic information, and detection metrics.
It serves as the core data structure of the \strong{conduit} package, enabling
downstream analysis and visualization of protein abundance, taxonomy, and
quality statistics.
}
\details{
The \code{conduit} class is designed to combine raw quantitative proteomics data
with functional and taxonomic context, streamlining analyses that link protein
abundance with microbial community structure.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{QFeatures}}{A \link[QFeatures:QFeatures-class]{QFeatures::QFeatures} object containing proteomics data,
including:
\itemize{
\item Protein abundance measurements across samples
\item Sample metadata (\code{colData})
\item Feature metadata (\code{rowData})
\item Multiple assays (e.g., raw, normalized, or transformed data)
}}

\item{\code{metrics}}{A named list of tibbles, each containing a distinct set of metrics
from the experiment. Examples include file-level statistics reported by DIA-NN,
summaries of detected taxonomy, or taxonomic coverage. This structure allows for
flexible storage of multiple, heterogeneous metric types and is designed to be
extensible as new metrics are added.
\itemize{
\item diann_stats: File-level statistics from DIA-NN
\item detected_taxonomy_summary: Summaries of detected taxa
\item protein_coverage_by_taxa: Number of proteins detected per taxon
relative to the total number of proteins in the database for that taxon.
The percentage represents coverage of the taxon's proteome.
}}

\item{\code{database}}{A tibble containing taxonomic information for all proteins in
the reference database, including:
\itemize{
\item Protein identifiers
\item Organism identifier (NCBI)
}}

\item{\code{annotations}}{A tibble (long format) containing taxonomy and detection
information for identified protein groups, enriched with functional annotations
retrieved from external sources (e.g., GO, KEGG, Pfam). This slot complements
the \code{database} slot by providing additional metadata specific to detected
proteins, beyond what is present in the original FASTA database.
Includes:
\itemize{
\item Taxonomic classification of detected proteins
\item Detection statistics for each taxon or protein group
\item Functional annotations retrieved via API calls (e.g., GO, KEGG, Pfam)
\item Quality metrics for protein identification
}
\itemize{
\item Taxonomic classification of detected proteins
\item Detection statistics by taxon
\item Quality metrics for protein identification
}}

\item{\code{taxonomy}}{A tibble containing the taxonomy detected in the experiment
Includes:
\itemize{
\item NCBI taxonomic ids
\item Full taxonomic designation (Domain - species)
\item Organism type (user-specified ie host vs microbiome)
}}
