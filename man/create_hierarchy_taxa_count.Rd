\title{Create Hierarchical Taxonomy Count Structure}
\usage{
create_hierarchy_taxa_count(
  data,
  levels = c("domain", "kingdom", "phylum", "class", "order", "family", "genus",
    "species")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing taxonomic information. Must have
columns corresponding to the taxonomic levels specified in the \code{levels} parameter.
Each row should represent a unique taxon at the most specific level (e.g., species).}

\item{levels}{A character vector specifying the taxonomic levels to include in the
hierarchy, ordered from most general to most specific (default: c("domain",
"kingdom", "phylum", "class", "order", "family", "genus", "species")). The
columns in \code{data} must match these level names.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing:
\itemize{
\item parent: The taxonomic name of the parent level
\item labels: The taxonomic name of the current level
\item ids: Unique identifiers for each taxon (same as labels)
\item count: Number of entries for each taxon
}
The output is structured hierarchically, with:
\itemize{
\item A root level (empty parent) containing counts of unique taxa at the
most general level
\item Subsequent levels showing parent-child relationships between taxa
\item Counts representing the number of entries at each taxonomic level
}
}
\description{
Generates a hierarchical data structure for taxonomic counts, creating parent-child
relationships between different taxonomic levels. This function is particularly
useful for preparing data for hierarchical visualizations like sunburst plots or
taxonomic trees.
}
\note{
This function is particularly useful for:
\itemize{
\item Preparing data for hierarchical visualizations
\item Analyzing taxonomic distributions
\item Creating interactive taxonomic plots
}
The function assumes that:
\itemize{
\item Taxonomic levels are ordered from general to specific
\item Each taxon at a specific level belongs to exactly one parent taxon
\item The input data contains all necessary taxonomic columns
}
}
\examples{
# Create hierarchy from taxonomy data:
# hierarchy <- create_hierarchy_taxa_count(taxonomy_data)

# Use custom taxonomic levels:
# hierarchy <- create_hierarchy_taxa_count(taxonomy_data,
#   levels = c("phylum", "class", "order", "family"))

# The resulting hierarchy can be used with visualization functions:
# plot_sunburst(hierarchy)
# plot_taxa_tree(hierarchy)

}

sunburst plots from the hierarchy

tree visualizations
\item \code{\link[count_proteins_per_taxon]{count_proteins_per_taxon}} for
counting proteins at each taxonomic level
