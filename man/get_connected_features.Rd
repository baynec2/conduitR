\title{Get Feature IDs Connected to a Given Feature in an Adjacency Matrix}
\usage{
get_connected_features(qf, i = "protein_groups", am_name = "adjacencyMatrix")
}
\arguments{
\item{qf}{A \code{QFeatures} object.}

\item{i}{Character. Name of the assay to use (default: \code{"protein_groups"}).}

\item{am_name}{Character. Name of the metadata element containing the
adjacency matrix (default: \code{"adjacencyMatrix"}).}
}
\value{
Character vector of feature IDs connected to the row \code{id} in the
adjacency matrix. Note: \code{id} must be available in the calling environment
(e.g. passed from a caller that has it).
}
\description{
From a QFeatures assay that has an adjacency matrix in its metadata, returns
the feature IDs (column names) that are connected to the row specified by
\code{id} (i.e. non-zero entries in that row).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# After building a QFeatures object with adjacency matrix metadata
ids <- get_connected_features(qf, i = "protein_groups")
# Use a specific feature id from the assay:
feature_id <- rownames(qf[["protein_groups"]])[1]
connected <- get_connected_features(qf)
# (id would need to be set in scope for the function body to work)
}
}
