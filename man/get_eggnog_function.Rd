\title{Get Functional Annotations from EggNOG Database}
\usage{
get_eggnog_function(eggnog_ids)
}
\arguments{
\item{eggnog_ids}{Character vector containing one or more EggNOG ortholog group IDs
(e.g., "ENOG502S5P5"). These IDs can be obtained from EggNOG-mapper or other
orthology prediction tools.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing functional annotations with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item eggnog_id: The input EggNOG ortholog group ID
\item go_type: Type of GO term (e.g., "biological_process", "molecular_function")
\item go_id: The GO term identifier
\item go_description: Description of the GO term
\item evidence_codes: GO evidence codes supporting the annotation
\item seq_count: Number of sequences in the ortholog group
\item frequency: Frequency of the GO term in the ortholog group
\item annotation_count: Number of times the GO term is annotated
}
If an EggNOG ID is not found or returns an error, that ID will be omitted from
the results with a warning message.
}
\description{
Retrieves Gene Ontology (GO) terms and other functional annotations for proteins
using their EggNOG ortholog group IDs. This function queries the EggNOG API to
obtain detailed functional information including GO terms, evidence codes, and
annotation statistics.
}
\note{
This function:
\itemize{
\item Requires an internet connection to access the EggNOG API
\item May take some time for multiple IDs due to API rate limiting
\item Returns NA for any fields that cannot be retrieved
\item Handles API errors gracefully with warning messages
}
The EggNOG API is free to use but has rate limits. For bulk queries, consider
implementing appropriate delays between requests.

\examples{
# Get functional annotations for a single protein:
# insulin_annotations <- get_eggnog_function("ENOG502S5P5")

# Get annotations for multiple proteins:
# protein_annotations <- get_eggnog_function(
#   c("ENOG502S5P5", "ENOG410XNJK", "ENOG410XNJL")
# )

# Use the results for downstream analysis:
# - Filter by GO type
# - Analyze most common functions
# - Compare functional profiles
