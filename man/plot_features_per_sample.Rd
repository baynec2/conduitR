\title{Plot Number of Features Detected per Sample Count}
\usage{
plot_features_per_sample(qf, assay = "protein_groups")
}
\arguments{
\item{qf}{A \code{QFeatures} object.}

\item{assay}{Character. Name of the assay to use (default: \code{"protein_groups"}).}
}
\value{
A ggplot object: bar chart of count of features (y) vs number of
samples they are detected in (x).
}
\description{
For a chosen assay, counts how many features (e.g. proteins) are detected in
1 sample, 2 samples, ... N samples, and plots a bar chart of these counts.
Useful to assess detection consistency across samples.

qf <- diann_to_qfeatures("report.parquet")
