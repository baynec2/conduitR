\title{Plot Data on KEGG Pathway Map}
\usage{
plot_kegg_pathway(qf, assay_name, kegg_pathway_id, ids_to_color = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{qf}{A QFeatures object containing the data to visualize}

\item{assay_name}{Character string specifying which assay contains the IDs to map
(default: "log2_imputed")}

\item{kegg_pathway_id}{Character string specifying the KEGG pathway ID to plot
(default: "03018", which is RNA degradation)}

\item{ids_to_color}{Named numeric vector where names are KEGG IDs and values are
the data to use for coloring (e.g., expression values, fold changes). If NULL,
will attempt to extract data from the QFeatures object.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. The function displays a pathway map where:
\itemize{
\item Nodes represent proteins/genes in the pathway
\item Node colors indicate the values in ids_to_color
\item The pathway structure shows relationships between components
}
}
\description{
Visualizes protein or gene expression data on a KEGG pathway map using the pathview package.
This function creates a pathway diagram where nodes (proteins/genes) are colored according
to their expression values or other quantitative data.
}
\examples{
# Plot a specific pathway with expression data:
# plot_kegg_pathway(qfeatures_obj, "protein", "00010")

# Plot RNA degradation pathway with custom IDs:
# plot_kegg_pathway(qfeatures_obj, "log2_imputed", "03018",
#                  ids_to_color = c(K04077 = 1, K04078 = -1))

# Note: KEGG pathway IDs can be found at https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html
