\title{Plot Sample Correlation Heatmap}
\usage{
plot_sample_cor_heatmap(qf, assay_name, sample_annotation_variables)
}
\arguments{
\item{qf}{A QFeatures object containing the data to analyze}

\item{assay_name}{Character string specifying which assay to use for correlation analysis}

\item{sample_annotation_variables}{Character vector specifying which columns from
colData to use for sample annotations (e.g., c("group", "batch", "treatment"))}
}
\value{
A ComplexHeatmap object containing:
\itemize{
\item Main heatmap showing Pearson correlations between samples
\item Color scale from viridis palette
\item Top and right annotations showing sample metadata
\item Consistent color schemes for annotation variables
}
}
\description{
Creates a heatmap visualization of Pearson correlations between samples,
with optional sample annotations displayed as colored bars. This is useful
for assessing sample relationships and identifying potential batch effects
or experimental groups.
}
\examples{
# Basic correlation heatmap:
# plot_sample_cor_heatmap(qfeatures_obj, "protein", NULL)

# With sample annotations:
# plot_sample_cor_heatmap(qfeatures_obj, "protein", 
#                        c("group", "batch"))

# With multiple annotation variables:
# plot_sample_cor_heatmap(qfeatures_obj, "protein",
#                        c("treatment", "timepoint", "replicate"))
}
