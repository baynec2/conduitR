\usage{
plot_selected_features(
  qf,
  assay_name,
  features,
  x_axis,
  facet_formula = NULL,
  color_by = NULL,
  shape = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{qf}{A QFeatures object containing the data to plot}

\item{assay_name}{Character string specifying which assay to use for plotting}

\item{features}{Character vector of feature IDs to plot (e.g., protein IDs)}

\item{x_axis}{Character string specifying the column name to use for the x-axis
(typically a sample or group identifier)}

\item{facet_formula}{Optional formula for faceting the plot (e.g., ~group)}

\item{color_by}{Optional character string specifying a column to use for point colors}

\item{shape}{Optional character string specifying a column to use for point shapes}
}
\value{
A ggplot object containing a scatter plot with:
\itemize{
\item X-axis showing the specified variable
\item Y-axis showing feature values
\item Points colored and/or shaped by specified variables
\item Optional faceting based on the provided formula
}
}
\description{
Creates a scatter plot showing the expression/abundance values of selected features
(e.g., proteins) across samples, with options for customizing the visualization
through faceting, coloring, and point shapes.
}
\examples{
# Basic plot of selected proteins:
# plot_selected_features(qfeatures_obj, "protein", 
#                       features = c("P12345", "P67890"),
#                       x_axis = "sample")

# With grouping and faceting:
# plot_selected_features(qfeatures_obj, "protein",
#                       features = c("P12345", "P67890"),
#                       x_axis = "timepoint",
#                       color_by = "group",
#                       facet_formula = ~treatment)

# With custom point shapes:
# plot_selected_features(qfeatures_obj, "protein",
#                       features = c("P12345", "P67890"),
#                       x_axis = "sample",
#                       shape = "replicate")
