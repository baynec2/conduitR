\title{Prepare QFeatures Object from Multiple Data Matrices}
\usage{
prepare_qfeature(
  sample_annotation_fp,
  vector_of_matrix_fps,
  vector_of_matrices_names = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_annotation_fp}{Character string specifying the file path to the sample
annotation file. This file should be a tab-delimited text file containing sample
metadata, with a "file" column that matches the column names in the data matrices.}

\item{vector_of_matrix_fps}{Character vector containing file paths to the data matrices.
Each file should be a tab-delimited text file with features as rows and samples
as columns. The first column should contain feature identifiers.}

\item{vector_of_matrices_names}{Optional character vector specifying names for each
matrix in the QFeatures object. If NULL (default), names are derived from the
matrix filenames by removing "_matrix.tsv" extension.}
}
\value{
A QFeatures object containing:
\itemize{
\item Multiple assays, one for each input matrix
\item Shared sample annotations (colData) across all assays
\item Feature annotations (rowData) specific to each assay
\item Consistent sample identifiers across all components
}
Each assay is stored as a SummarizedExperiment object with:
\itemize{
\item assay: The quantitative data matrix
\item rowData: Feature metadata from the first column of each matrix
\item colData: Sample metadata from the annotation file
}
}
\description{
Assembles a QFeatures object from a list of data matrices and sample annotations.
This function is particularly useful for integrating multiple types of quantitative
data (e.g., protein abundances, peptide intensities) into a single, organized
data structure that maintains relationships between features and samples.
}
\note{
This function:
\itemize{
\item Requires consistent sample identifiers across all inputs
\item Automatically handles feature identifiers as row names
\item Preserves all sample metadata from the annotation file
\item Creates a hierarchical data structure for multi-level analysis
}

Important considerations:
\itemize{
\item Sample annotation file must have a "file" column
\item Matrix files must be tab-delimited
\item Column names in matrices must match sample identifiers
\item Feature IDs should be unique within each matrix
}
}

# Basic usage with default matrix names (from filenames)

# Custom assay names
