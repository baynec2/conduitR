diann --cfg config/proteotyping_firstpass_diann_spectral_library.cfg --fasta resources/databases/first_pass_database.fasta --threads 24 --out-lib resources/databases/first_pass_database 

Output will be filtered at 0.01 FDR
Precursor/protein x samples expression level matrices will be saved along with the main report
A spectral library will be generated
Deep learning will be used to generate a new in silico spectral library from peptides provided
DIA-NN will carry out FASTA digest for in silico lib generation
